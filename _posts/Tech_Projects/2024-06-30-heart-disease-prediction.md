## Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project explores the use of machine learning models to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on a dataset of health metrics. It was the capstone project for my MSc in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence.

###  Objective
To build a predictive model that can support early diagnosis and personalized healthcare using real-world health data.

###  Tools & Technologies
- **Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: pandas, NumPy, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
- **Models Used**: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, SVM, KNN, and MLP
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Accuracy, F1-score, Confusion Matrix, ROC Curve

###  Outcomes
- Random Forest and XGBoost were the top performers
- Provided visual insights into feature importance and data distribution
- Demonstrated effective preprocessing, model tuning, and evaluation
