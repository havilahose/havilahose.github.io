#  Teaching & Education

As a Computer Scientist with a strong background in Data Science and AI, I am currently teaching Computing and ICT in secondary school. My goal is to empower students with real-world digital skills, spark curiosity in technology, and help every learner believe in their potential.

##  My Teaching Philosophy

I believe every student has the ability to succeed when learning is made **engaging, inclusive, and purposeful**. I aim to:
- Make Computing approachable through real-life examples and project-based learning
- Adapt lessons for **diverse learning styles** (visual, auditory, kinesthetic)
- Ensure all learners — including those with **SEN** — feel seen and supported

---

##  Subjects I Teach

- Computing (KS3–KS4)
- ICT
- Science (cover lessons)
- Maths (KS3–KS4)
- Basic Literacy (for EAL learners and lower ability groups)

---

##  My Classroom Experience

- Currently teaching Computing at **Hilbre High School**
- Previously worked as an **IT teacher** at **Flourish High School**
- Supported **GCSE** and **A-Level** students in preparing for exams
- Created learning resources adapted for **students with special needs**
- Known for a calm, consistent, and positive classroom presence

---

##  Skills in Practice

- Differentiation for SEN and EAL learners
- Positive behaviour management
- Planning lessons using curriculum frameworks
- Integrating digital tools (like Scratch, Python, Google Classroom)
- Using formative assessment and feedback effectively

## 📥 Teaching Resources (Coming Soon)
I plan to share downloadable lesson slides, revision worksheets, and computing projects for students and new teachers.
